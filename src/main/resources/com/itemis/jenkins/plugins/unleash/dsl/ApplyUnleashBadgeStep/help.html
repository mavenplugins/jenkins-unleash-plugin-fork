    Applies the Unleash badge to the current Pipeline build.
    This step should be used only once in the Pipeline build.
    The Unleash badge is added to the build run by <code>applyUnleashBadge(version: '1.0', dryRun: false)</code> so it will be displayed in the build history of the Pipeline job.
